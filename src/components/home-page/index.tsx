              The Center for Computational Biomedicine Imaging and Modeling
              (CBIM) was founded by Professor Dimitris Metaxas in 2001 to serve
              as an environment for conducting novel research in the areas of
              Computational Biomedicine, Computer Vision, Computer Graphics,
              Scientific Computations, Learning and Robotics. CBIM has 10
              faculty members and around 30 graduate students. It is located in
              a space comprising of almost 11,000 square feet which includes a
              separate space for human motion capture experiments. Funding for
              CBIM is provided by all major Government agencies such as NIH,
              NASA, NSF, ARO, ONR and AFOSR. CBIM has several collaborative
              projects with research and faculty from other major Universities
              and research labs such as Boston Univ. UPENN, Columbia, NYU
              Medical School, MIT, Stanford, Brookhaven National Laboratory,
              Siemens Healthcare and Adobe Systems.
